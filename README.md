# GPT iOS String Localization

This GitHub action translates your base language .strings files into multiple languages using the OpenAI API and opens a Pull Request with the translations. Include a context comment on each string to improve the translation quality.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warnings**
- The OpenAI API is currently not available for free. You need an API Key issued with a `paid account` to use this workflow.
- This action works reliably using gpt-4, however this model is currently only available through a waitlist. You can still test this Action with gpt-3.5-turbo, however it is not recommended since it ocasionally includes additional characters or format errors that can break your .strings file. 


This is a GitHub Action that uses GPT-4 to translate .strings files into multiple languages.
Add context to your translations by appending a comment for each string:

```"sign_in_email_field" = "Sign In"; /* Context: Label used in email field on sign in page */```

The localization updates will be posted on a Pull Request.
