# GPT iOS String Localization

This GitHub action translates your base language ```.strings``` files into multiple languages using the OpenAI's ```GPT-4``` API and opens a Pull Request with the translations. 

Add context to improve the translations by simply including a comment on each string:

```
"sign_in_email_field" = "Sign In"; /* Context: Label used in email field on sign in page */
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning**‚ö†Ô∏è
- The OpenAI API is currently not available for free. To use this action you'll need to sign-up for a paid account and generate an API Key.
- This action works reliably using ```gpt-4```, however this model is currently only available through a waitlist. You can still test this Action with ```gpt-3.5-turbo```, however it is not recommended since it ocasionally includes additional characters or format errors that can break your .strings file.
